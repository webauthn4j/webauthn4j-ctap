== Introduction

=== What's WebAuthn4J UnifidoKey

https://github.com/webauthn4j/UnifidoKey[WebAuthn4J UnifidoKey] is an Android app, which turns your smart phone to a security key.
You no longer need to purchase and carry around an expensive physical security key.
By installing the UnifidoKey app on your smartphone, you can use your smartphone as a security key in the smartphone's browser or the other devices that support passkey.

Unlike other Passkey Providers such as Google Password Manager, UnifidoKey does not synchronize data between devices.
Instead, keys are securely stored in non-exportable storage within the device, providing security suitable for enterprise applications that require key attestation.

=== Install

Install from Google Play Store

=== Precautions for use

For security reasons, UnifidoKey does not provide a method to back up keys stored within it.
In case of device lost or unexpected issues with UnifidoKey, please prepare alternative authentication methods to the service other than UnifidoKey so that you can recover your account even if UnifidoKey becomes unavailable.

We advise using UnifidoKey only for services with stringent security requirements.
For standard services, we suggest using other Passkey Providers like Google Password Manager, which supports synchronization.

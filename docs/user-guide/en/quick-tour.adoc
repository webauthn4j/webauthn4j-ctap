=== Set up

UnifidoKey offers two types of transport methods. NFC transport and Bluetooth HID transport.

==== NFC transport

If your smartphone on which Unifido Key is installed has the NFC feature and the NFC reader is connected to your PC,
you can use the UnifidoKey with NFC transport.

===== Enable NFC transport

Enable NFC transport of the UnifidoKey app, and place your smartphone to the NFC reader.
The reader must support NFC. The reader which only supports Felica and MIFARE doesn't work.
We tested with https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/gp/product/B00VR1WARC/[Sony NFC Reader "PaSoRi " RC-S380/S].

==== Bluetooth HID transport

If Bluetooth is available on your PC, you can use the UnifidoKey with Bluetooth HID transport.

===== Enable Bluetooth HID transport

Enable UnifidoKey's Bluetooth HID transport and pair it with your PC before using it.

====== Pairing

Press "PAIRING" button in the home screen, and "ALLOW" to make your smart phone visible to other Bluetooth devices.
Then, search for your smart phone from your PC bluetooth pairing wizard and complete the pairing.

====== Troubleshooting Bluetooth HID transport

If the status of the Bluetooth HID device does not become "connected" even though Bluetooth is enabled on both the PC and smartphone,
disable the Bluetooth transport once and then enable it again, or turn off the Bluetooth adaptor of the smartphone and then turn it on again.,
then, please try again.

===== Keep running Bluetooth HID transport in background

The Bluetooth HID transport is normally only available when the app is open,
but by enabling the "Stay Background" checkbox, you can keep running the Bluetooth HID transport even when the app is not open.
Please note that it will affect the battery consumption.
During standby, "Unifido Key Bluetooth HID Service" will appear in the Android notification menu.
You can disable the background mode with the "Turn Off" menu there.

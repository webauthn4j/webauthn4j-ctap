=== Use UnifidoKey as a security key via NFC transport

If your smartphone, where UnifidoKey is installed, supports NFC and your Windows PC is equipped with an NFC reader,
you can use UnifidoKey as a FIDO2 NFC security key as an experimental feature. For normal use cases, pairing via QR code is sufficient, and there is no need to use NFC connection.

==== NFC transport

If your smartphone on which Unifido Key is installed has the NFC feature and the NFC reader is connected to your PC, you can use the UnifidoKey with NFC transport.

==== Enable NFC transport

To activate UnifidoKey NFC transport, first enable the Experimental Mode from the UnifidoKey settings screen.
Then, enable the NFC transport from the transports section.
Now you can use UnifidoKey as a FIDO2 NFC security key by placing your smartphone on the NFC reader of your PC.
The reader must support NFC. It cannot be used with readers that only support FeliCa or MIFARE.
